# Maritime collision

The maritime collision dispute type asks each agent structured questions, then analyses their responses with respect to the [Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law with respect to Collisions between Vessels](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/other/dfat/treaties/1930/14.html).

When all questions have been answered, the module attempts to simulate might what happen in court should the dispute be taken to court and the same answers are given.

## Disclaimer

The module is an estimate of what might happen in court and by no means should be taken as fact. It is intended to be a helpful, automated second opinion to trained specialists, not for the general public.

# Maritime Collision

This is a module for the [SmartResolution](http://smartresolution.org) online dispute resolution platform.

It adds a "maritime collision" dispute type, which supports specialised questions and then an approximation of what might happen in court, based on the given answers and maritime law itself.

## @TODO

This is a temporary list, exploring what is required of the underling system for this module to be supported:

* we may need to add an item when the dispute is in negotiation, fully underway, or in mediation, so the platform should support that level of specificity.
